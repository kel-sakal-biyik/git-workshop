# Scenario 9

## 🏁 Objective

You've implemented a new feature. While you were working on the new feature you've also seen
than you could do some refactoring on a different file because you are following the scout's rules
After you are done with your refactoring, you've realized that you forgot to add typings
in your actual feature. But you already committed its changes. You need to do these changes on the previous commit so it will be easier to review your PR with all related changes in the same commit.
