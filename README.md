# Scenario 5

## 🏁 Objective

You've done with your feature and you've created your PR. Then some of your colleagues
found some "linting" issues in your work! So you've created another commit to fix those
issues. Before you want to push it you want to merge your commits together. But this time
your previous commit message is good and you don't need to edit it.

## 💡 Hint

_You need to fix up your previous commit_
