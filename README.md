# Scenario 7

## 🏁 Objective

Your fellow developer friend handed you over a feature since he is going to vacation tomorrow.
You finalized the feature with your commit and you want to squash all the previous commits before
pushing it. However, someone else has merged his PR to this branch somewhere during the progress. So there is a merge commit in between.

## 💡 Hint

_Sometimes it's the best to have a reset_
