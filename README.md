# Scenario 10

## 🏁 Objective

Your colleague is asking for help. He said he has a bug which is not present on master.
He is sure he introduced the bug within in one of his commits but he couldn't figure it
out which one. Could you help him to detect in which commit the bug is introduced?

## 💡 Hint

_We need to `bisect` and conquer_

_you can serve the HTML file to observe the bug by running the command `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` on your terminal._
